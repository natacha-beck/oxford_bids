# oxford_bids
Temporary repo to work on oxford_bids wrapper. 

## Two scripts added, Pierre Rioux, Sep 21, 2020

I added two scripts, they both are complete rewrite of the oxford_asl wrapper:

1. `bids_ox_asl` is my main implementation, it includes error checking, output capture, comments, and usage statement.
2. `rough_ox_asl` is the exact same code but stripped to the bare minimum: no error checking, no capture, etc.
    It is intended as a teaching example only, not as a production script.
